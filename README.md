## A Brief of the Prototype:
The prototype mainly consists of a codebase against a Python Notebook (a .ipynb file)
The code uses TensorFlow 2.0 frameworks and the oneDNN and oneDAL frameworks from the Intel oneAPI Toolkit
**Abilities of the prototype**
  1. It can read pictures from video frames of live video source
  2. It can estimate when and where to stop the car and when to move based on different situation son the road
  
## Tech Stack: 
   List of all the tech stacks used in the prototype are:
   1. OpenCV
   2. Intel extension for TensorFlow
   3. oneDNN framework for model enhancementand comparisons 
   
   
## Step-by-Step Code Execution Instructions:
  **Step 1:** Clone this repository into a C:// drive directory of your computer
  **Step 2:** Open the Object_Detection.ipynb file on any IDE (preferably Jupyter Notebook)
  **Step 4:** Run all the cells one by one to obtaina nd analyze the outputs and the final cell to receive live video stream feed
              and corresponding results
  
## What I Learned:
   Our entire team has put in a lot of effort in building the prototype, thanks to my fellow teammates and our Mentor Prof. Amartya Chakroborty
   We have surely learnt how to train an image classification model
   We have learnt the important features that needs to be extracted from an image frame for detecting objects in case of an autonomous vehicle
   We have learnt the ethics of AI modelling while dealing with the problem statement so as to deliver the best possible solution for growth based performance
